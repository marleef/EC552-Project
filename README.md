## Description
Lachesis is a genetic assembly optimization program that automizes part assembly steps based on costs. The program is designed to be customizable for the user, where they are able to enter an end goal part/parts, a monetary or hourly cost value correlating to the estimated wet lab costs or computational time of each assembly step or stage, and the program will output an assembly tree diagram, as well as the estimated cost of the maximum or minimum assembly process. 

## Instructions
#### 1. Install python 3.10 and pip
#### 2. Install Python Imaging Library
`python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
python3 -m pip install --upgrade Pillow`
#### 3. Clone Github Repository on your device 
`git clone https://github.com/marleef/EC552-Project.git`
Minimum of project.cpp and project_gui.py are required to be in the same directory to run the program. 

#### 4. Run Python Program using instructions below. 
For ease of use, ensure that the file of the part(s) you want to use is in the same directory as the file.  
`python project_gui.py`
